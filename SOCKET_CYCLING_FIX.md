# Socket Connection Cycling Fix

## Problem Identified
The socket connection was constantly reconnecting due to:
1. **useEffect dependency issues** - Functions in dependencies were recreating on every render
2. **Unnecessary socket cleanup** - Socket was being cleaned up and recreated even when already connected
3. **VideoRoom effect re-running** - Socket listeners were being re-registered constantly

## Fixes Applied

### 1. SocketContext Improvements (`src/contexts/SocketContext.js`)
- **Conservative socket reuse**: Only create new socket if user changes or connection is truly broken
- **Smarter connection logic**: Try to reconnect existing socket before creating new one
- **Removed `forceNew: true`**: Allow Socket.IO to reuse connections when possible
- **Better cleanup conditions**: Only cleanup when actually needed, not on every render
- **Removed function dependencies**: Removed `connectSocket`/`cleanupSocket` from useEffect deps

### 2. VideoRoom Stabilization (`src/pages/sessions/VideoRoom.js`)
- **Initialization tracking**: Added `isInitialized` state to prevent multiple socket listener setups
- **Reduced dependencies**: Removed function dependencies from socket listener useEffect
- **Better connection derivation**: UI status now derives from WebRTC state, not Socket.IO blips

### 3. Debug Tools Added
- **DebugSocketState component**: Visual monitoring of auth/socket state changes
- **Enhanced logging**: Detailed console output to track state changes and effect triggers
- **Socket stability monitoring**: Real-time tracking of connection status

## Debug Instructions

### Step 1: Monitor Console Output
Watch for these patterns in browser console:

**✅ GOOD (Stable Connection)**:
```
🔄 SocketContext useEffect triggered: {isAuthenticated: true, userIdExists: true, ...}
✅ SocketContext: Socket already connected, no action needed
🔄 VideoRoom socket effect triggered: {hasSocket: true, isConnected: true, ...}
⚠️ VideoRoom: Skipping socket setup (conditions not met)
```

**❌ BAD (Connection Cycling)**:
```
🔄 SocketContext useEffect triggered: (repeated rapidly)
🧹 Cleaning up socket connection... (repeated)
🔌 SocketContext: Attempting to connect... (repeated)
🔌 VideoRoom: Setting up socket listeners... (repeated)
```

### Step 2: Use Debug Component
The `DebugSocketState` component is now added to VideoRoom and shows:
- Render count (should be low/stable)
- Authentication status
- Socket connection state
- Real-time state changes

### Step 3: Check Effect Dependencies
If cycling continues, check for:
1. **Auth state stability**: User object shouldn't be recreating
2. **Socket state stability**: `isConnected` shouldn't flip constantly
3. **Component re-mounting**: VideoRoom shouldn't unmount/remount

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Normal Operation Sequence:
1. **Initial load**: `SocketContext useEffect triggered` → `Socket connected`
2. **VideoRoom load**: `VideoRoom socket effect triggered` → `Setting up socket listeners`
3. **Stable state**: No more "cleanup" or "setting up" messages
4. **Status derivation**: Connection status based on WebRTC state, not Socket.IO

### Connection Status Flow:
- **On page load**: `Disconnected` → `Connecting...` → `Waiting for peers...`
- **Peer joins**: `Waiting for peers...` → `Connecting...` → `Connected`
- **During call**: Status remains `Connected` without cycling

## Troubleshooting

### If Socket Still Cycling:
1. **Check AuthContext**: Verify user object isn't being recreated
2. **Check parent components**: Ensure VideoRoom isn't being unmounted/remounted
3. **Check dependencies**: Look for missing or extra dependencies in useEffect
4. **Check network**: Temporary network issues can cause legitimate reconnections

### Console Commands for Debugging:
```javascript
// Check current socket state
console.log('Socket state:', {
  socket: window.socket?.connected,
  auth: !!localStorage.getItem('token'),
  userId: 'check user object'
});

// Monitor socket events (run in console)
if (window.socket) {
  window.socket.onAny((event, ...args) => {
    console.log('Socket event:', event, args);
  });
}
```

### Quick Verification:
1. Open browser console on VideoRoom page
2. Look for debug component in top-left corner
3. Should see minimal render count and stable states
4. Console should show stable connection messages, not cycling

## Key Changes Summary

**Before**: Socket was being cleaned up and recreated on every render/state change
**After**: Socket is reused when possible, only recreated when truly needed

**Before**: VideoRoom effect ran constantly, re-registering listeners
**After**: VideoRoom effect runs once, initialization tracking prevents duplicates

**Before**: Connection status tied to Socket.IO state (caused flickering)
**After**: Connection status derives from WebRTC state (stable and accurate)

The application should now maintain stable socket connections without the constant cleanup/reconnect cycle that was causing performance issues and UI flickering.
